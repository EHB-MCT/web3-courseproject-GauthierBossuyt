        <h2>What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system" target="_blank">recommender system?</a>
        </h2>
        <p>A recommender system seeks to predict what a user might like based on collected information.</p>

        <h2>Types of recommender systems:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Popularity</h3>
                <p>
                    Recommends songs based of the song's popularity. The songs popularity depends on the metric used
                    (time, user interactions, user ratings, ...).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Content-based</h3>
                <p>
                    A content-based recommender uses attributes from items the user interacted with to recommend similar
                    items. The TF-IDF is a common method used for this type of recommender.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Collaborative</h3>
                <p>
                    Uses collaborative filtering to recommend items based of interactions by similar users.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Hybrid</h3>
                <p>
                    A combination of the collaborative and content-based recommender. The hybrid recommender performs
                    better, because it uses high variance and enables variety and weighting.
                </p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Types of filtering:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering" target="_blank">Collaborative
                        filtering</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Uses data from people, who have similar taste to make predictions about what you might like. Spotify
                    uses this type of filtering to create an user's Discover Weekly playlist.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">Natural Language
                        Processing</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Using computers to process and analyze natural language data to automaticly summarize the main
                    points of a text document. Spotify's NLP converts playlist to text documents to analyze how lyrical
                    patterns relate to each other. Spotify's NLP tries to locate places where the term is used and tries
                    to predict the meaning of the context. For example, when using the word 'ABBA' 'Dancing Queen' has a
                    high score with the adjectives 'perky' and 'nonviolent'.

            <li>
                <h3>Audio Models</h3>
                <p>
                    Processing raw audio to create a range of characteristics, such as key, energy, tempo, ... . This
                    way new songs from unknown artists can be recommended.

        <h2>The diffence between explicit and implicit feedback:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Explicit</h3>
                <p>
                    Explicit feedback is direct and quantitative data collected from users. Explicit feedback is rare,
                    because rating items isn't done frequently.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Implicit</h3>
                <p>
                    Implicit feedback is indirect and made from a users interactions. Implicit feedback comes in quite
                    large quantities and allows to make recommendations in real time. Nowadays most recommender systems
                    are built with implicit feedback.
